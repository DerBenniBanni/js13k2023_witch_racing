# Post Mortem for Witch Cup 1276

**IN PROGRESS**

The theme "13th century" was announced, and somehow in the first minutes it was clear to me: I want to do a racing game, with witches! (Thanks to some books like "Wyrd Sisters" from Terry Prattchett right next to my desk)

So where to start? As my pixel-skills are ~~not the best~~ miserable i decided to create the graphics using the drawing tools from canvas and some kind of random generators.
The second decision was, that it will be a 2.5d top-down view, like the old Amiga games often used (i.e. "Super Off Road")

## The first pixels: Trees

some lines and MANY ellipses

### Adding a subspecies: Pines

### Rocks

## Witches

Some circles and lines

## Prerendering the graphics

Rendering hundredthousand ellipses every frame is a bad idea..

## Background graphics

Second canvas below

## Editor for Racetracks

More tracks, and editable tracks

## Music

Corvus Corax and Soundbox
